    username: string containing login username
    password: string containing login password
    year: the year this application is for (so we can say nice things like
          "application for 2010-2011" with year.range)

{{ organization }} officers and advisor,

Your organization has an available SGA AFAP application to apply for funding
for the {{ year.range }} academic year. A due date has been set of March 24,
2011.

The application is available at http://afap.osusga.com/. Your organization has
been assigned a username and password of {{ username }} and {{ password }},
respectively. After logging in, you will find this years' application, any
application your organization submitted for funding last year, and various
other options. In particular, if you do not wish to receive any further email
regarding AFAP funding for your organization, please log in, select "Change
contact preferences", and deselect your name.

Informational sessions have been scheduled for Thursday, March 10 from 9:30 to
10:30, and Tuesday, March 22 from 12:00 to 1:00, both in CLB 407 (this is a
computer lab on the forth floor of the Classroom building).

Note that your organization has been placed in the {{ constituency_group }}
constituency group, which dictates the AFAP hearing your organization will
attend. If you believe this is in error, please contact me.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions, or if you need any
assistance with your application.

Bill Good
SGA AFAP Chair
