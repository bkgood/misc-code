{{ organization }} officers and advisor,

Your organization has been scheduled for the {{ constituency_group }}
hearing at {{ datetime|date:"l, F j, Y" }} at {{ datetime|date:"P" }} in {{ location }}.
Please ensure at least one person from your organization capable of discussing
the application is present at that time.

Also, this hearing committee (i.e., who decides on allocation amounts) is
composed of all the presidents of the applying organizations, if any
organization presidents can attend the full meeting (4:00 to approximately
6:00), please do so -- we must have at least 4. We also need 1 or 2
advisors for the full time; if any advisors are able to attend, please let
me know.
