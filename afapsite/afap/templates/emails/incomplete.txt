          "application for 2010-2011" with year.range)
    constituency_group: constituency group object
    negative_request: indicates if the request is negative
{% endcomment %}

{{ organization }} officers and advisor,

According to our records, your AFAP application is currently incomplete. Our
records indicate that your application has not been approved by all of your
organization's required officers. If you wish to submit your application for
consideration, please login and use the "Signatures" page to complete this
portion of the application. If you have officers who are for whatever reason
unable to complete this, please contact myself or the SGA office as soon as
possible or your application will be considered incomplete and not
considered for funding.

{% if negative_request %}
Additionally, according to the budget request portion of your application,
your income is projected to be greater than your expenses through the end of
the next academic year. This generally indicates that your group has no
monetary need from the AFAP fund, however, applications which have been
fully approved will be scheduled for hearings as has happened in years past,
although applications not requesting money will likely not be given
preferential treatment by the allocation committees.
{% endif %}

Any changes must be made by 4:00PM today (Monday, April 4). Applications not
fully approved will not be scheduled for an AFAP hearing.

Bill Good
SGA AFAP Chair
