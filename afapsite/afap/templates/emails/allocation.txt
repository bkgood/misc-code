{{ organization }} officers and advisor,

A new allocation has been recorded for your organization for the {{ year.range }}
academic year. Currently, the following allocations have been made:

{% for allocation in allocations %}{{ allocation.description }}: ${{ allocation.amount }}
{% endfor %}Total AFAP allocation for {{ year.range }}: ${{ sum }}

If you are in need of any additional money from AFAP, an appeals meeting
has been scheduled for Thursday, April 21 from 4-6p.m. in the
Student Union French Lounge (SU270), in which allocations will be made
on a first come, first serve basis.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
