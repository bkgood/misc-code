This is the Django web application I created to record and manage student
organization funding requests for the Oklahoma State University Student
Government Association. It uses South for database schema changes, and
ReportLab to generate PDF files for review in meetings.


Some notes:
afap contains the web application code
util contains various utility scripts I wrote to aid in administration

Licensing and ownership:
All included files are of my own creation, with one exception:
afap/templates/admin: most of these have been copied from the Django
distribution, but I had to make a few changes.


All personal data that is not my own has been removed, and my contact
information redacted.
