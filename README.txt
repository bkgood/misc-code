This is a collection of various works in software development from my years in
university. Many subdirectories have their own README files, which note any
files not owned and created solely by myself.

Unless otherwise stated, all files are released without stipulation. Most of
these are school projects, which wouldn't be of much use to the general
population, anyhow.

Directory:
afapsite: Django web application I created to record and manage funding requests
from student organizations for the Oklahoma State Student Government
Association.
cs3363: assignments from an Organization of Programming Languages class.
Includes samples of Pascal, SML and Common LISP code.

cs3443: assignments from a Computer Architecture/Organization class. All
assignments are written in MIPS assembler, targeted to the SPIM simulator.

cs4173: assignments from a Video Game Development course. All assignments are
written in C#, using XNA, and a small part of the final group project, written
using Unity (a part of my contribution to the project).

cs4323: assignments from a course on Operating Systems. Both assignments were
written to test understanding of multi-threaded programming.

cs4343: assignments from a course on data structures and algorithms.
