Programming assignment 2
Due Nov 9, 2010

Run the program with `python hashtable.py`. This will print out all the
hash tables multiple times as described in the assignment, for a more concise
view (so that the search activity is more easily seen), run
`python hashtable.py q`. `./hashtable.py` should also work as the executable
bit should be set.
