Programming assignment 1
Due Oct 5, 2010

Compilation:
make

Execution:
./sorts

This assignment has been written in GNU C99 using only the standard library as
provided on csx. The different sorting algorithms are implemented in
insertion.c, merge.c, heap.c and quick.c. main.c contains the execution,
timing and output code, including the main program routine. Due to the speed
of some implementations at lower values of n, the time taken is immeasurable
by the system and reported as 0.0 seconds. Dramatic further speed increases
can be attained by appending -O3 to the CFLAGS variable in the Makefile.
